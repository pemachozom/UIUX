        <div class="items">
            <h2>The Problem</h2><br>
            <p>A joined marketplace is necessary for Bhutanese textile aficionados and artists to purchase and sell traditional textiles from Bhutan. It is now difficult for buyers to find genuine textiles and for sellers to attract a wider audience due to the fragmented nature of the business and lack of a dependable internet presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="items">
            <h2>The Goal</h2><br>
            <p>Create an app that links buyers and sellers of textiles from Bhutan, offering a smooth and culturally immersive shopping experience. Simple navigation, safe transactions, and thorough biographies of craftsmen and their creations should all be made possible by the app.

    <div class="pain">
        <div class="items">
            <h2>1. Authenticity Assurance</h2>
            <p>Buyers: Buyers find it difficult to locate genuine Bhutanese textiles and to verify the legitimacy and quality of products when they shop online. In order to foster trust and provide transparency, this knowledge will direct the design to incorporate artisan biographies, thorough product descriptions, and safe transaction procedures.

        <div class="items">
            <h2>2. Seller Empowerment</h2>
            <p>For Sellers: It might be challenging for sellers to successfully showcase their skills and reach a wider audience. In order to help sellers draw in and interact with potential customers, the design will going ahead concentrate on developing thorough seller biographies, user-friendly listing tools, and elements that showcase the distinctive qualities of their fabrics.
